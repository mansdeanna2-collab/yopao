    "description": "Send greetings to friends and family overseas with the latest international stamp from the U.S. Postal Service featuring a colorful illustration of an 18th-century compass rose. The 32-point compass rose from the Collections of Maine Historical Society depicted on this round stamp was drawn by Lucia Wadsworth. the aunt of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. in her school geography notebook in 1794. when she was 10 years old. She brightly colored the directional points in blue. red. yellow. and green. A compass rose is a round figure on a map that helps users of the map orient themselves by showing the direction of north and other points of the compass. The earliest known compass rose was drawn in the 1300s and was used to indicate the directions of the eight principal winds. Now they are typically shown as the four cardinal directions (north. south. east. west) and four intercardinal directions (northeast. southeast. northwest. southwest). More elaborate compass roses show the directions not only of the eight principal winds. but also the half-winds and quarter-winds. which were used as points of orientation. The term \"compass rose\" comes from the resemblance of the directional points to the petals of roses. Art director Greg Breeding designed the stamp. This Global stamp can be used to mail a one-ounce letter to any country to which First-Class Mail International? service is available. As with all Global stamps. this stamp will have a postage value equivalent to the price of the single-piece First-Class Mail International first-ounce machineable letter in effect at the time of use. The?1794 Compass Rose?Global stamp is being issued in self-adhesive panes of 10.",

    "description": "The inspiration for Uncle Sam is generally considered to be Sam Wilson. a meat packer in Troy. New York. During the War of 1812. Wilson was responsible for shipping rations to soldiers. All packages were required to carry the initials of the contractor (in this case. Elbert Anderson) and the country they came from (the United States). The rations Wilson mailed bore the letters E.A. and U.S. Most of what Wilson sent went to Greenbush. NY. where many soldiers from Troy were stationed. The men who received the rations knew Samuel Wilson and his nickname. \"Uncle Sam.\" When asked where the rations came from these men responded \"Uncle Sam.\" The joke caught on with other soldiers and soon the name was being used interchangeably with the United States. Then on September 7. 1813. the Troy Post published an article on the war that included an early printed use of Uncle Sam to represent the United States. The article stated. \"Loss upon loss. and no ill luck stirring but what lights upon Uncle Sam’s* shoulders. exclaim the Government editors in every part of the country\" * This cant name for our government has got almost as current as ‘John Bull.’ The letters U.S. on the government waggons. &c.. are supposed to have given rise to it.\" Two weeks later. another newspaper in Burlington. Vermont sent out a call for volunteers to protect private property from attacking British troops. The article said that there was a shortage of enlisted men because \"Uncle Sam. the now popular explication of the U.S. does not pay well.\" Samuel Wilson died in 1854. but the name Uncle Sam lived on.\" Over the years. Uncle Sam was pictured in a variety of ways — including closely resembling Benjamin Franklin during the Civil War. Thomas Nast’s political cartoons in the 1870s introduced the famous outfit — striped pants. a tailcoat. and a tall hat. Nast also took qualities from Abraham Lincoln and used them to draw Uncle Sam in his cartoons. Uncle Sam was first illustrated as we know him today during World War I. His most famous appearance was on a recruitment poster created by James Montgomery Flagg. Flagg’s image of Uncle Sam as an elderly man with white hair. goatee. and red. white. and blue top hat struck a cord with Americans. Flagg didn’t want to bother hiring a model. so instead based Uncle Sam on himself. aging his own features. The poster depicted a stern image of Uncle Sam declaring. \"I Want YOU For U.S. Army.\" The poster was printed over four million times and was so successful that it is still a national icon over 100 years later. Some critics have argued that Sam Wilson is not the man behind the country’s famed fictional representative. But in 1961. Congress made the story official resolving that \"Congress salutes Uncle Sam Wilson of Troy. New York. as the progenitor of America’s National symbol of Uncle Sam.\"",

    "description": "Disney had previously been featured on two US stamps. One in 1968. honored Walt Disney himself. Another was issued in 1998 as part of the Celebrate the Century Series. which pictured a scene from Snow White. It was honoring the film because it was the nation’s first feature-length animated film. In 2004. the USPS worked with Walt Disney artists to create the first stamps in the Art of Disney Series. The set would include the first US stamp to picture Mickey Mouse. even though many other nations had issued Disney and Mickey stamps before. The first set in the series was dubbed the Art of Disney: Friendship. and featured some of Disney’s enduring friendships. The stamps were issued on June 23. 2004. at Disneyland in Anaheim. California. The first-day ceremony was held in front of the park’s Sleeping Beauty Castle and was attended by the postmaster general and Disney’s CEO. Michael Eisener. The postmaster said that with these stamps. \"we get the chance to capture the spirit of friendship as it appears in the art. the imagination and the creative tradition of Walt Disney.\" Eisner then noted that it was a rare honor for Disney to be featured on our stamps and that he was \"pleased that millions will have the chance to brighten their correspondence with Mickey Mouse. Goofy. Donald Duck. and other Disney friends.\" The series continued in 2005 with the Art of Disney: Celebration stamps. ?Each stamp pictured Disney characters celebrating together. ?They were issued on June 30. again at Disneyland in Anaheim. California. These stamps also celebrated the 50th anniversary of Disney’s theme parks. The third set in the series honored romance and was issued on April 21. 2006. Each of the stamps pictured one of Disney’s famous couples. The stamps were issued in Orlando as part of the 13th annual Epcot International Flower and Garden Festival at Disney World. In 2007. the series continued with the Art of Disney: Magic. Each of the stamps features magical characters or magical moments from Disney history. The stamps were issued on August 16. 2007. at the American Gardens Theater at Walt Disney World in Orlando. The final set in the series was issued on August 7. 2008. Titled The Art of Disney: Imagination. these stamps specifically honored Walt Disney. All of the characters pictured are from films he touched with his creative vision. The stamps were issued at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. Though not part of the Art of Disney Series. the USPS issued a few more stamps in the years to come that featured Disney characters.",

The forever stamp will always be valid as first-class postage on standard envelopes weighing one ounce or less. regardless of any subsequent increases in the first-class rate. The stamp art depicts the liberty bell. which is perhaps the most prominent and recognizable symbol associated with American independence. Over the years. the historical significance of the bell’s message has transcended our national borders. and today the liberty bell is an international icon of freedom. Replicas of the liberty bell exist in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. The stamp art features a computer-generated image of the liberty bell by nationally acclaimed artist tom Engeman of Brunswick. Maryland. His previous projects for the postal service include stamped cards for Carlsbad caverns national park (2002). Ohio University (2003). and Columbia University (2003). as well as the 2003 American eagle definitive stamp. and the national world war ii memorial stamp issued in 2004. Made in the USA.",

    "description": "The pansy has been associated with love since ancient times. Its name comes from the French word pense. meaning “thought.” and is named for the flower’s resemblance to a human face. In many cultures around the world. pansies are believed to inspire thoughts of loved ones and even heal broken hearts. According to Greek legend. the god of love Eros (known as Cupid in Roman mythology) once shot a love arrow at a young woman. but missed and instead hit a flower. turning it purple and causing it to smile. English playwright William Shakespeare referenced this myth in his play A Midsummer Night’s Dream. In his story. mischievous forest fairies make a love potion that causes the characters to fall in love using the lazy love plant. which was “formerly milky white. but now purple with the wounds of love.” An old German legend claims that the pansy once exuded such a sweet scent that people traveled thousands of miles just to smell it. However. in doing so. they trampled the surrounding vegetation. leaving no fodder for cattle and no food for humans. So the pansy prayed to God. who removed its smell and turned it into the beautiful flower it is today. In England. the legendary Knights of the Round Table once visited a fortune teller to use the pansy to predict their love future. The knights would be happy when the pansy had no more than seven wrinkles on its face. Because then the flower foreshadowed good luck in love.",

    "description": "As the days get shorter and the air turns crisp. the time comes to decorate for the holidays. The perfect tree is selected and the ornaments are taken down from the attic. The tradition of decorating the Christmas tree begins. Trees were first brought inside at Christmas in the 1600s. The early ornaments were nuts. berries. and fruit. symbols of plenty. Candles and silver? tinsel added much-needed light to winter rooms. Handmade ornaments were lovingly prepared and became cherished keepsakes. Just as it was then. each family today has its own Christmas tree traditions. Some use decorations passed down from previous generations. others are unique to that family… delicate glass balls brought from the homeland generations ago… a glitter-covered baked-dough star made years ago by a? child who is now an adult… brightly colored glass balls bought for the family\" s first Christmas. Today. strings of lights give trees a warm glow. and plastic tinsel reflects glimmers of light into the room. just as the pure silver strips used to do. The custom of decorating the tree and the fond memories it brings to mind are part of what makes Christmas a favorite time of year for so many.",

    "description": "On September 20. 2011. the USPS issued its fourth semi-postal stamp. to raise money wildlife conservation. As early as 2000. the World Wildlife Fund and Wildlife Conservation Society proposed the USPS create a semi-postal stamp to help raise money for wildlife conservation. Their efforts paid off when Congress passed the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semi-postal Stamp Act of 2010. Issued on September 20. 2011. the semi-postal stamp pictures an Amur tiger. Also known as the Siberian tiger. the Amur once roamed Western and Central Asia.?Their organs and bones. used in Asian medicine. and their lush pelts made them a profitable target for poachers. During the 20th century. the Amur tiger vanished from several nations and its wild population became nearly extinct throughout the region. Today. only a few hundred are known to roam freely. The image of an Amur tiger cub was made by Nancy Stahl. the artist behind more than 20 US postage stamps. She used photographs of the species as inspiration for the stamp. The Save Vanishing Species semi-postal stamp sold for 11\" | more than the first-class postage rate at the time. The additional funds were given to the US Fish and Wildlife Service to support worldwide conservation efforts. They. in turn. gave the funds to the Wildlife Without Borders program. which funds conservation efforts. both inside and outside the US. The program issues grants to five different multinational groups involved in protecting elephants. rhinoceros. tigers. marine turtles. and great apes. By joining conservation agencies from around the world. the United States is able to cross borders to reverse the threat of extinction to these animals. According to a WWF representative. \" This is an easy way for individuals to use their purchasing power to help save vanishing species every time they mail a letter. By purchasing these stamps. anyone can play a direct role in protecting some of our most iconic and endangered wildlife.\" The original law made the stamp available from September 2011 until December 2013. During that time. over 25 million stamps were sold. raising over $2.75 million dollars. In 2014. President Obama signed a bill reauthorizing the Save Vanishing Species stamp to continue sales through 2018. As of July 2018. the stamp has raised over $5.2 million.",

Selected from the Army’s 3rd Infantry Regiment. the tomb guards are an elite group who stand sentinel around the clock. regardless of weather conditions.?The guards follow a meticulous routine that consists of marching down the length of a black mat behind the tomb. They then turn and face east. turn and face north. and return down the mat. After each turn. the guards perform a \"shoulder-arms\" movement signifying their readiness to handle any threat.?The guards are changed every 30-120 minutes. depending on the season and time of day. and the schedule does not change due to inclement weather.

Gingerbread has roots in a centuries-old recipe. with varied ingredients globally. The gingerbread houses loved by Americans today differ significantly from the medieval version. The name originates from \"gingerbras.\" a term borrowed from thirteenth-century France meaning \"preserved ginger.\" In the days before refrigeration. people added bits of this spice to recipes to mask the odor of spoiled meat. By the next century. it became known as gingerbread. In the 15th century. one of the earliest-known recipes called for boiling breadcrumbs in honey. spicing them. and pressing them into wooden molds. In 16th century England. bakers replaced breadcrumbs with flour. adding eggs and sugar. Queen Elizabeth I. a dessert enthusiast. is credited with introducing the first gingerbread man. Gingerbread houses decorated with candy soon became a holiday tradition. In some countries. wine. brandy. or ale are common ingredients. In other regions. bakers use candied citrus peel. pepper. or anise instead of ginger. Honey and molasses often replace sugar. Regardless of the recipe. the charming gingerbread cottages are sure to delight family and friends.",

    "description": "While the types have changed. flowers have been an important part of weddings for thousands of years. In ancient Greece. the bride\" s bouquet contained bulbs of garlic and sprigs of dill or sage. The garlic warded off evil spirits. the dill ensured the bride would only desire her husband. and the sage promised wisdom and goodness. Herbs were also used in Swedish weddings. The groom put thyme in his pocket to discourage trolls from becoming uninvited guests.Young girls walked down the aisle carrying small bouquets of herbs.In England. a small girl led the bride and groom to the church. sprinkling blossoms along the path to bring long life and happiness to the couple.This tradition has survived through time. and the flower girl is a common sight at many modern weddings.In 1840. England\" s Queen Victoria began a fashion trend when she carried a \"Tussie Mussie\" at her wedding. This small bouquet included flowers with special meaning. such as roses for love and poppies that represented the pleasure her new husband would bring to her life.Whether the bride\" s bouquet includes garlic or poppies. this long-standing tradition is a symbol of future joy.As with the\" Yes I Do\" Heart of Roses stamp. the \" Where Dreams Blossom\" Wedding Bouquet stamp was designed by Ethel Kessler using an illustration by Michael Osborne. This stylized bouquet stamp was issued for use on the save-the-date notices. response cards. and thank-you notes.",

    "description": "Printing Method: Lithograph printed in booklets 20 Songbirds. also known as passerines. make up nearly half of the world’s bird species. totaling about 4.000. These small. migratory birds inhabit various global habitats and stand out with their bright coloring and distinct songs. The characteristic melody of a songbird comes from its highly developed vocal organ or song box. often coupled with an elongated windpipe. Each songbird species possesses a unique set of songs. and individual birds perform variations in tone or pitch for neighbor identification. While all songbird vocalizations serve as social communication. not every call is considered a \"song.\" Recognized songs are typically tunes used by male songbirds during courtship. breeding. and territory establishment and maintenance. Females occasionally sing. and some species engage in duets. thought to strengthen the bond of mated pairs. For reasons still unknown. songbirds showcase their vocal skills most effectively during the early hours of the morning. Year-round. early risers can appreciate the \"dawn chorus.\" a daily medley. with spring being the best time in temperate climates. International Dawn Chorus Day officially recognizes this avian beauty each May. drawing bird lovers worldwide to witness the spectacle. Illustrator Robert Giusti depicted the Western Meadowlark and other songbirds in this set perched on branches or fence posts. His artwork is featured on other stamps. including Tufted Puffins (#4737). Birds of Prey (4608-12). and a Cardinal (2480).",

The 1964 television special that tells his story added a character named Hermey to enhance the holiday tale. Hermey. one of Santa’s helpers. lacks pointed ears like the others and is the only elf with hair on top of his head. He differs from the other elves by dreaming of being a dentist rather than a toy maker. Threatened with firing by his supervisor. Hermey decides to run away from Santa’s workshop. Upon meeting Rudolph. who is also running away from home. Hermey decides to join him. The duo is soon joined by Yukon Cornelius. an arctic prospector in search of a peppermint mine. Their adventure begins when the Abominable Snow Monster spots Rudolph’s nose and pursues them. The trio’s chase takes them to the Island of Misfit Toys and ends with everyone safe at home. including the newly tamed Snow Monster. and Hermey becoming a dentist. Edits were made after the original show aired. Newer versions have Yukon in search of silver and gold. and Santa visiting with the Misfit Toys. Both versions are heartwarming tales eagerly anticipated each holiday season.",

    "description": "This stamp commemorates 200th anniversary of Star-Spangled Banner.?The stamp image is from a photo of flag that flies over Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine.It was taken during fireworks display at annual Defenders Day celebration. During the War of 1812. Mary Pickersgill was commissioned to sew a flagso large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance.The flag was to fly over Baltimore\" s Fort McHenry. which the British hoped to capture. Pickersgill was asked to make \" one American ensign. 30×42 feet. first quality bunting.A smaller flag of lighter materials was also ordered for use during bad weather.Over 400 yards of wool bunting was needed to construct the larger flag. which weighed about 50 pounds.?Because of its size. the work was done on the floor of a nearby brewery after the business had closed for the day. The British began bombarding Fort McHenry on September 13. 1814. ?Francis Scott Key witnessed the 25-hour assault from a ship in Chesapeake Bay.?Because it was raining heavily. Key likely saw the smaller flag at ?twilight\" s last gleaming.But as morning neared. the oversized flag was defiantly hoisted above Fort McHenry.The sight inspired Key to write lyrics about the?star-spangled banner. If not for fate. the Battle of Fort McHenry would have had a more explosive ending. Only the forts commander knew that its gunpowder magazine. over which some 2.000 shells fell. was not bombproof.?A direct hit would have destroyed the fort instantly. Gary Clark was the photographer for the stamp s image.He said it was difficult to get the fireworks and the flag at the same time because it was windy the night he took the photo at the Defenders Day celebration.",

More importantly. each gift also holds spiritual meaning:?Gold represents Jesus’ divinity and kingship on Earth. frankincense symbolizes his holiness. and myrrh refers to his eventual suffering and death. The legend of these meaningful presents and the Magi who brought them remains a significant part of the Christmas story.?It was the wise men’s generosity that established the holiday gift-giving tradition known in Western Christianity today. a custom celebrated by millions each December.

Ancient Romans wore wedding rings on the third finger of the left hand.They believed a vein in the ring finger ran directly to the heart.The ring\" s never-ending circle represented everlasting love back then. and it still does. A big concern during weddings many years ago was evil spirits disrupting the celebrations.In Rome. the bride wore a veil to disguise herself from these creatures who were jealous of her happiness.In other countries. female friends of the bride dressed like her and walked down the aisle to confuse any presence that wanted to do harm to the future wife.Irish weddings included the ringing of bells to keep the evil spirits away and encourage a harmonious marriage.Brides also carried small bells in their bouquets. Medieval Europeans were concerned the spirits would enter the newlywed home on the soles of the bride feet.The groom carried his new wife over the threshold to keep out the unwelcomed guests. Many old wedding observances remain. though some meanings have been lost over time.These remnants of the past add to the enjoyment of the couple and loved ones who share their special day.

    "description": "Shortly after Charles Schulz introduced the comic strip?Peanuts?in 1950. Charlie Brown emerged as its main character. Mild-natured. insecure. often defeated and yet eternally optimistic. Charlie Brown appealed to everyday folks who had also experienced disappointment. Schulz had envisioned Charlie Brown as \"a caricature of the average person.\" Although he only ages from four to eight years old during the comic strip’s 50-year run. Charlie Brown is intelligent and philosophical with good leadership skills. His tendency to overthink life leads him to procrastinate. This is compounded by his reluctance to start a new day for fear he will spoil it. Yet Charlie Brown remains hopeful that tomorrow will be a better day. buoyed by the support of his friends. These themes of insecurity. philosophy. failure. and optimism led to several running jokes over the years. They include Lucy and the football. visits to her psychiatrist booth. deep conversations about life at the wall. and Charlie Brown’s baseball team’s never-ending losing streak. These themes form the heart of?A Charlie Brown Christmas. as he searches for the true meaning of the holiday — and ultimately finds it with the help of the other members of the?Peanuts?gang. Each of the Charlie Brown Christmas stamps features a still taken from?A Charlie Brown Christmas. Art director Antonio Alcal\" designed the stamps.",

Though often connected with romance and passion in Greek and Roman mythology. it wasn’t until the Victorian era that the rose solidified its status as a symbol of love. At that time of high moral standards. floriography. the secret language of flowers. was used to convey otherwise inappropriate ideas too forbidden to speak about. Different flowers were given certain meanings. and dictionaries were published to define the various possible messages. Feelings could be expressed discreetly through a bouquet or a single flower. A white rose stood for innocence. orange for desire. pink for admiration. and purple for enchantment. A red rose suggested love and enduring passion. an association that still holds true today.",

    "description": "Flurries. squalls. snowstorms. nor’easters. snow bursts\" all may deposit significant amounts of white fluffy precipitation from the sky. but none meet the definition of a blizzard. To qualify as a blizzard. snow must fall continuously for at least three hours with accompanying winds of at least 35 miles per hour. reducing visibility to under a quarter mile. Anything falling short of these criteria is simply categorized as snowfall. However. under the right conditions. regular snowfall can escalate into a full-blown blizzard. Blizzards are not only feared for the hazardous conditions they generate but also for the aftermath of these severe storms. Downed power lines and outages often ensue in the aftermath of a blizzard. Harsh temperatures and limited heating options can result in frozen and burst pipes. leading to flooding and property damage. These storms typically bring substantial snowfall. making roadways slippery. obstructed. or even completely impassable. Roofs may collapse under the weight of heavy snow. and the physical exertion of shoveling has been known to trigger heart attacks. While modern meteorology cannot mitigate the severity of blizzards. the ability to predict such storms fortunately helps reduce their impact on those in their path. Antonio Alcal\" and Leslie Badani designed the 2015 Snowflake stamps. featuring various types of snowflakes in different colors.",

    "description": "The Chesapeake Bay’s Thomas Point Shoal Light stands atop metal posts screwed into the bay’s bottom. The original 1825 onshore stone tower on Thomas Point was replaced in 1838 due to poor resistance against point erosion. In 1875. Congress opted for a screw-pile light. and Thomas Point Shoal Light was erected. illuminated for the first time in November that year. To secure the structure. cast iron beams drove 12 feet into the bay’s bottom. Enduring considerable battering. winter ice dislodged and destroyed the original lens in 1877. Additional supports were introduced to the screw-pile foundation for stability after lens replacement. By 1964. Thomas Point Shoal Light became the last manned lighthouse in the Chesapeake Bay. automated in 1986. As of 2021. it remained the last unaltered screw-pile cottage-type lighthouse on its original foundation in the Chesapeake Bay. symbolizing Maryland and its rich history.",

    "description": "As the 19th century produce industry became a big interstate business. competition among growers increased. Each sought new and unique advertising gimmicks to beat out their rivals. They hired skilled lithographers to design and print vibrant crate labels. Images of bright yellow lemons and vivid red tomatoes popped off the labels. enticing customers and effectively marketing the various brands. Before the turn of the century. stone lithography was still widely used. Artists hand-etched their graphic designs into limestone. applied ink. and then pressed the images onto heavy paper labels. In the following century. steel and photo-offset lithography made the process easier and cheaper. By the end of the 1940s. the crate label mass marketing movement was at its peak. A lithography company might have employed a hundred artists to keep up with the demand. But only a decade later. preprinted cardboard boxes replaced wooden shipping crates. making the crate labels obsolete. Many old crate labels still exist in collections and antique shops. The remaining examples provide a timeline of agricultural marketing over three-quarters of a century. Today referred to as \"agro-lithography.\" these images offer a colorful glimpse into the history and changes in American advertising during that time. The art for these stamps was inspired by vintage shipping crate labels. seed packets. and catalogs inspired. Each stamp in the set was designed and drawn by Michael Doret.",

Botanical art has complemented gardening catalogs and magazines for over two centuries. In 1784. David Landreth established the first mail order seed catalog. His reputation grew and soon Landreth’s customers included George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Landreth introduced the zinnia to the United States in 1798. followed by the first truly white potato. and then the tomato. In 1832. he unveiled the nation’s first floral and horticultural magazine. ?Following Landreth’s success. the 19th century saw an explosion of seed companies and catalogs. The Industrial Age ushered in items of convenience and created more leisure time for many Americans. Elaborate flower gardens came in trend. and seed catalog covers were the best place to showcase new varieties. ?The W. Atlee Burpee Company was especially skilled in promoting new and improved seed varieties each year. Beautifully executed cover art created desire for these new varieties. and sales soared. Other companies soon followed suit and many still prefer using cover art over photography today.",

Muhammad and his small army of 313 men set out for the oasis at Badr to intercept the caravan. When the nobles in Mecca found out about the planned raid. they joined forces to protect their possessions.The two armies met. with the Meccan forces three times as numerous as Muhammad troops. Three champions from each side fought first. and all three men from Mecca were killed.A full-scale attack followed. The Muslim holy book. the Quran. reports thousands of angels came from Heaven and terrorized the enemy.The large army fled. This victory increased the prophet reputation and led to the expansion of Islam.Muhammad men. who had fasted before battle. feasted that evening. Today. Muslims celebrate the breaking of fasts with Eid festivities of their own.",

Religious themes. especially the Madonna and Child. dominated artworks in churches and museums. Florentine artists. each with a distinct technique. commonly embraced naturalism or realism. aiming for detailed. precise. and lifelike representations. The prevalent medium for 15th-century painters was egg tempera on wooden panels. Artists mixed powdered pigments with egg yolk. occasionally adding white wine or vinegar. Egg tempera’s strong odor. even after drying. led some artists to incorporate myrrh for a more pleasant scent. Creating egg tempera demanded skill. and its durability allowed some masterpieces to endure. offering a firsthand look at Renaissance art’s evolution.",

    "description": "Jack-o’-lanterns have been symbols of Halloween in the U.S. since the late 19th century. Based on legends tracing back to Europe. a man named Jack tricks the Devil in unscrupulous ways that prevent Jack from going to Heaven which also infuriates the Devil. who refuses to carry Jack’s soul to hell. With nowhere to go after he dies. Jack forever wanders the earth with a lantern made from a hollowed-out turnip lit by an ember from the fires of hell. a fate that earns him the name Jack of the Lantern. In North America. native pumpkins proved to be a more fitting medium for carving. Although Halloween itself is now largely a non-religious celebration. it grew out of All Hallows’ Eve. which is the night before All Saints’ Day. an early Christian observance still widely celebrated today.

He said 15 million of the stamps were printed.The stamp is based on a photograph taken of the northwest corner of the museum with its three-tier. bronze-colored facade that conveys faith. resilience and hope and pays homage to enslaved African-American craftsmen from New Orleans and Charleston. South Carolina. \"The stamp that we dedicate today captures the majestic beauty of this museum.\" said Ronald A. Stroman. deputy postmaster general for the postal service. He said the postal service was crucial to helping create a black middle class because it hired African Americans in the early 20th century when many other businesses wouldn’t. \"Forever\" stamps are always valid for first-class postage in the U.S.. regardless of any future rate increases. Some 30 million people each year visit one of 19 Smithsonian Institution museums and art galleries in Washington and New York. The goals of the African-American museum. which was authorized by an act of Congress in 2003. are to \"break the silences that have divided America and to help us remember that we are all shaped and made better by the African-American experience.\" Bunch said. The stamp caps a remarkable year for the museum. which former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush opened in 2016 with much fanfare.",

    "description": "Santa Claus is a widely popular symbol of Christmas. However. many may not know he is based on a real person — Saint Nicholas. Saint Nicholas was born in the 14th century to wealthy Christian parents. They died in an epidemic when he was young and he moved in with his Uncle Nicholas — a bishop. Young Nicholas was deeply religious and took to heart the readings and teachings of Jesus. He began using his inheritance to anonymously assist the sick and needy. Although he left gifts down chimneys at night. a few found out he was behind the generosity. Nicholas begged for them to keep it a secret because he didn’t want the attention on himself. In the Middle Ages. French nuns began leaving pouches of coins. food. and treats in the homes of the needy at night. When asked where these gifts came from. the nuns would simply say \"it must have been Saint Nicholas.\" This inspired the anonymous gift giving as well as all the carols. The song \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\" comes from a poem written by Emily Huntington Miller. Her poem was published as \"Lilly’s Secret\" in December 1865. The poem was later set to James Lord Pierpont’s 1857 melody of \"Jingle Bells.\" Saint Nicholas has inspired the world with his generosity. which continues every Christmas season.",

    "description": "Skywriting has been amazing people with its beauty and mystery since the early 1900s. It was first used by British Royal Air Force pilots to send messages to the ground when other communications failed. It then became an advertising tool for companies like Pepsi. In more recent years. people have hired skywriters to write personal messages to loved ones. There are two types of skywriting: traditional and skytyping. Both forms feed paraffin oil through the plane’s exhaust to create a trail of white smoke. In traditional skywriting. the release of oil is controlled by a switch in the plane’s cockpit. For skytyping. a computer controls when the smoke is released. Traditional skywriting requires a specially trained pilot. They create a detailed flight plan with the letters written in reverse. Each maneuver is precisely timed so the message is legible on the ground. Skytyping is faster and easier. but less elegant. Five planes fly in parallel lines. releasing puffs of smoke to form the message. Unlike traditional skywriting. skytyping consists of broken dots instead of solid lines. Today. people stop in their tracks to watch skywriters at work. Whether it be a simple advertisement. personal message. or even a marriage proposal. skywriting is a rare and awe-inspiring art form. It brings joy and wonder to all who witness it and lends a little magic to the everyday.",

    "description": "The stamp art features four striking designs that highlight the handsome plumage of these resident birds. The vivid contrast with the bright flashes of color found in the digital rendering of each bird evokes the drab feeling of winter with the stark white backgrounds. A limited palette and simplified shapes give the art a bold. fresh look. In the dead of winter. when trees have shed their leaves and snow has blanketed the ground. the lively sights and sounds of resident birds can be a welcome relief. For serious birders or casual nature lovers alike. spotting these beautiful creatures in backyards. parks. and forests is a treat during the year\" s coldest months. Art director Antonio Alcal\" \" designed the stamps with original artwork by Nadia Taylor. The Birds in Winter stamps are being issued as Forever stamps in booklets of 20. These Forever stamps will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce price.",

    "description": "One of the most famous frozen treat brands in the United States is Popsicle. Responsible for the very first frozen treats on a stick. Popsicle has an interesting backstory\" The Popsicle was invented in 1905. near San Francisco by 11-year-old Frank Epperson. Young Epperson had mixed soda powder and water with a wooden stirring stick and forgotten it outside overnight. It was an especially cold evening. and when Epperson went out the next morning. he found his drink had frozen solid around the stirring stick. Rather than waste it. he decided to simply lick the frozen drink off the stick. He called his accidental discovery an Epsicle ice pop and made more to sell around his neighborhood. In 1923. Epperson was selling his Epsicles at a local amusement park and received a patent for his invention in 1924. Not long after. Epperson’s children began calling his invention a \"Popsicle.\" creating the famous brand name still known today. Epperson faced financial difficulties throughout the 1920s and decided to sell the rights to his invention and company. The Popsicle brand has gone through several ownership changes. but their goal of sharing delicious frozen treats with America has remained the same. Today. the Popsicle brand is a household name and continues to sell billions of frozen treats every year.",

    "description": "The art of writing love letters has existed for hundreds of years. Electronic messages are most common today. making handwritten notes?even more special now than they have ever been. People have expressed their love in different ways since the dawn of civilization. When written communication first appeared. love letters soon followed. From Ancient Egypt to Tudor England to Revolutionary America. countless examples of romantic messages have been discovered — including those between founding father John Adams and his wife. Abigail. Over the years. as love letters became more?popular. certain guidelines were developed to help one express their feelings. These rules were followed especially close during the Victorian era. Men customarily wrote their letters on plain paper while women’s letters could be more ornate. sometimes including ribbons. flowers. or a dab of perfume. But both were encouraged to be sincere while not revealing too much of their affections. Technology has led to a decline in handwritten communication. but love letters still remain. Taking the time to write and mail messages shows true devotion. These letters are an enduring symbol of commitment. thoughtfulness. and. of course. love.",

    "description": "The Battle of Fort Sumter was a 34-hour stand-off that marked the opening of the Civil War. The flag that flew over the fort during that battle?would go on to inspire thousands of Americans as they fought their way through the long war. During the April 1861 battle. the flag\" s pole was shot down and a lone soldier braved heavy enemy fire to raise it again. After the battle ended. the fort\" s commander insisted the flag be lowered to a 100-gun salute. During the ceremony. the guns accidentally set off a pile of rifle cartridges. killing two men and injuring five others. The first casualties of the war were suffered while paying honor to the flag. That battle-worn flag was taken to New York City for a Union rally attended by over 100.000 people. The Fort Sumter flag then went on a multi-city tour through the North. In each town. it was auctioned off to raise money for the war effort. Whoever won the flag then donated it back to be auctioned in the next city. The flag served as an important patriotic symbol and rallying point throughout the war. It was returned to Fort Sumter exactly four years after the surrender as part of the celebrations of the Union\" s victory. It was there at the start and it was there at the end \" C the Fort Sumter flag was a beacon of hope in battle and at home. helping the Union persevere.",

Texas rainbow. dahlia. scarlet hedgehog. hatchet. golden Tom Thumb. eagle’s claw. glory of Texas. and silver ball. They are just a handful of the many cacti that produce beautiful flowers. Generally. cacti are rather slow-growing plants. They can be started from seed. but usually will not reach adult size for several years. Even then. it takes even longer for the plant to reach maturity and begin to flower. ?One of the most well-known species. teh saguaro cactus. takes over 100 years to bloom. ?When a cactus does finally produce flowers. they last for only a day or two before dying off. While at their peak. cactus flowers are some of the most stunning and delicate of any other bloom. Since cactus flowers are so short-lived. pollinators in their habitats have to be quick to get to the delicious nectar inside. ?Each cactus species is specially adapted to suit a particular animal that pollinates them. ?Some are large and white so that bats can easily locate adnd feed from them. ?Others grow deeper. making them a favorite stop for hummingbirds \" C some of these flowers will hide this tiny pollinator’s entire body while it feeds! Thanks to these creatures. flowering cacti are able to keep producing fruit and seeds. which will make more plants and ensure their breathtaking flowers will be around for years to come.",

    "description": "While many other butterfly species can be found across North America. the California dogface butterfly’s range is limited to Central and Southern California. ?This led California to adopt the dogface butterfly as its official state insect in 1972. Commonly located in wooded areas of the Santa Ana Mountains. the California dogface is picky about its habitat. Adult butterflies feed mainly on nectar from purple flowers like thistles. Eggs are laid only on false indigo plants. with caterpillars feeding on the vegetation until they pupate. Male dogface butterflies’ wings are yellow-orange with black sections on the upper pair (forewings) \" C a design that resembles a dog’s face. This earned the species its strange name. ?Females. on the other hand. are completely yellow with a single dark spot on each forewing. The California dogface butterfly’s unique wing pattern makes it a sought-after species by many nature photographers. ?However. the california dogface flies exceptionally fast. making it difficult to spot one with its wings open long enough to take a photo. These butterflies only remain still while they are drinking nectar \" C making them a rare and beautiful sight.",

All you need is a wire wreath frame (available at most craft stores). about 25 evergreen branches (two feet long). garden shears. florist’s wire. and wire cutters. ?First. remove the smaller arms from each evergreen branch. These will be the pieces that make up the wreath. ?To attach them to the wreath frame. make bunches of three or four branches and wind the florist’s wire around the cut ends. securing them to the frame. Add more bunches in the same way. slightly overlapping each other until the wreath is complete.When it’s time to decorate your wreath. you can add any ribbons. pine cones. and ornaments you like. There is nothing better than a beautiful hadmade wreath hanging on your front door for the holidays",

Coral reefs are formed over thousands of years mainly by colonies of animals called polyps. Polyps make stony corals. the foundation for most coral reefs. by secreting protective skeletons of calcium carbonate or limestone. As these limestone skeletons accumulate over time ?a with new colonies of polyps growing on top of the skeletons of older ones ?a they build up the base of coral reefs. Coral reefs are some of the world\" s most marvelous ecosystems. sheltering and sustaining about a quarter of all ocean species. Anyone who has snorkeled in tropical environments has witnessed the sea come alive when approaching a coral reef. Suddenly an abundance of fish of all types and colors appear. along with a variety of other animals and plants. including sea urchins. seagrass. octopuses and lobsters. Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamps. Tyler Lang created the stamp art.",

Drug use can have negative impacts not only on individual health and functioning. but also on the well-being of families and entire communities. Recent surveys indicate that more than 50 million Americans age 12 or older\" nearly one in five people\" have used an illicit drug in the previous year. and. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. overdose is a leading cause of injury-related death in the U.S. To fully address drug use requires a unified effort at every level of the community. Research has demonstrated that children are less likely to use drugs. alcohol. and tobacco when their parents or other adults communicate clearly and consistently about the risks. Educators. health care professionals. and policymakers can all play a role in addressing drug use through prevention and early intervention.",

Their achievement was over a decade in the making and the result of the combined efforts of over 400.000 scientists. The Moon landing was fueled by the Space Race. which began in 1957 when the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite. The US and USSR spent several years working to out-do each other. Then in 1961. President John F. Kennedy set the goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. Thousands of American scientists joined together to achieve Kennedy’s goal. ?And millions watched anxiously on July 16. 1969. as the Saturn V rocket launched into space. Four days later. the?Eagle?landing module separated from the—olumbia?command module and began its descent. As the?Eagle?approached the lunar surface. the astronauts realized they were traveling faster than expected and would land miles beyond their target. Armstrong took control of the module and landed it with just enough fuel for the return trip. Hours later. Armstrong took his famous first steps out of the module. stating \"That’s one small step for a man. one giant leap for mankind.\" The Apollo 11 crew and NASA’s scientists had made history. won the Space Race. and ushered in a new era of space exploration.",

In studies. it has been proven that love leads to fewer colds and less pain. meaning fewer doctor’s visits. ?Love also speeds up healing time from injuries. lowers blood pressure. and decreases anxiety. Overall. love helps reduce stress. which leads to a longer lifespan and an increase in general hapiness. In a time when technology is becoming the preferred method of communication. the way people fall in love is changing. But no matter how unusual or unlikely the circumstances. falling in love will always be in style. ?It is amazing that a happy relationship with another person can have so many positive effects on the human body. And researchers say there are likely even more benefits they have not discovered yet. Love really is “a many-splendored thing!”",

The Giving Tree. published in 1964 by Harper & Row. is about a friendship between a motherly tree and a boy. As the child grows older. the tree gives him its shade. apples. branches and trunk. The story ends with the boy. now an old man. returning to rest against the tree’s stump. The best-selling tale of selflessness. which is accompanied by the author’s elegantly simple black-and-white illustrations. is considered a classic of children’s literature. Silverstein’s zany. self-illustrated books of poetry are similarly revered. Where the Sidewalk Ends (1974). A Light in the Attic (1981). Falling Up (1996) and Every Thing On It (2011) feature clever and. at times. playfully nonsensical verse that is adored by young people all over the world. Children are enthralled by Silverstein’s poetry. which is full of fantastical imagery and often deals with the joys and fears of childhood. The four distinctive collections of poetry were best-sellers. The New York Times named Where the Sidewalk Ends an Outstanding Book of 1974; Silverstein’s album version of the book earned a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children. The multi-talented Silverstein also wrote and illustrated books for adult readers. He recorded his own songs in addition to writing hits for other artists. Silverstein’s music has appeared in many films. In the 1980s. he wrote plays performed off-Broadway in New York. He died in May 1999 at his home in Key West. FL.",

    "description": "Yosemite National Park is known for soaring rock faces and unforgettable scenery. Part of what makes this park so beautiful is the Merced River that flows through Yosemite Valley. The Merced River originated around 10 million years ago when the Sierra Nevada mountains were still being formed. In fact. the Merced and other waterways eroded the rock between the mountains. helping create the peaks and valleys we see today. Glacial activity was also a major factor in shaping the Sierra Nevada landscape. This includes the path of the Merced River. From the base of Clark Range at 8.017 feet above sea level. the Merced flows through Yosemite National Park and on until it eventually empties into the San Joaquin River. ?Its total journey spans 145 miles. One of the most breathtaking pieces of the Merced River is where it crashes over two of Yosemite’s famous waterfalls \" C Vernal and Nevada Falls. While some Yosemite waterfalls can only be seen during snowmelt in the spring. Vernal and Nevada Falls (together nicknamed the “Giant Staircase”) flow all year. ?In fact. there are a series of hiking trails that allow visitors to climb to the top of both. In 1987. Congress established 122 miles of the Merced River as a Wild and Scenic River. ensuring its natural beauty can be enjoyed for many years to come.",

Most of the time. these colors are provided by visiting songbirds who stick around throughout the year. ?Many people like to help these birds by putting up feeders. but there is a better way\" Planting winter berries. Winter berries are trees or shrubs that keep their fruit throughout the winter months. These plants are the best way to help backyard songbirds (and other wildlife) survive the cold temperatures. ?Some species of winter berries keep their leaves. while others just keep their branches and fruit. In 2019. the United States Postal Service honored four species of winter berries on postage stamps:? winterberry. juniper. beautyberry. and soapberry. The first three are popular winter food sources for many animals. ?This includes birds like woodpeckers. quail. robins. waxwings. and catbirds. which normally prefer insects. When planting winter berries. it is important to identify the shrubs and trees native to your area and choose those. This reduces the risk of non-native plants out-competing native species. ?It will also ensure your berries are equipped to handle your climate. Whether you plant winter berries to help out the birds. or to bring much-needed color to your backyard. they are sure to make you smile despite the snowy weather.",

    "description": "Like the six previous global forever stamps issued since the first appeared in 2013. the new stamp is a round self-adhesive with die-cut simulated perforations. The central image of a pink chrysanthemum is credited as an existing photograph by Hong Vo. The stamp was designed by Greg Breeding. working with USPS art director William J. Gicker. It was offset printed by Ashton Potter (USA) Ltd.. one of the Postal Service\" s two current contract printers. The global forever stamp concept was developed following public acceptance of the domestic-rate forever stamp for letter mail sent within the United States. The round shape and the \" GLOBAL\" inscription are intended to alert users that the global forever stamp is intended for international mail. The global forever stamp is always valid for the current first-class international letter rate for machineable mail weighing 1 ounce or less. That rate increased from $1.15 to $1.30",

    "description": "Giving movement to the music. b-boys and b-girls (b stands for break) are talented performers who display their athleticism through impressive dance moves. These moves often seem to defy gravity. While acrobatic street performances have been popular since the 1800s. \"breaking\" was born in the 1970s. DJ Kool Herc was the first to loop the rhythmic breakdown of songs. creating a beat for dancers to improvise moves to. Many dance moves were inspired by martial arts. gymnastics. the lindy hop. and disco. Breaking generally consists of four different types of moves. Toprock refers to dance moves performed in a standing position. Downrock. also known as footwork or floorwork. involves the dancer using their hands for support as much as their feet. Power moves are acrobatic moves in which the dancers use their upper body for support while the rest of their body creates momentum for fast and impressive movements. Finally. freezes are gravity-defying poses in which breakers suspend themselves off the ground. sometimes on just one hand. These usually mark the end of a set. but can be strung together for a dramatic display. While breaking used to be limited to street corners and parties. it has reached mainstream popularity today. It can be seen in movies and on TV and has been the focus of dance competitions around the world.",

Perhaps this is why seven is believed to be known as the symbol for perfection and completion in both the physical and spiritual sense. ?Whether the founder of Kwanzaa.

Mayflower. finally arrived in the New World. and they disembarked near modern-day Cape Cod. Massachusetts. This event became a defining moment in American history. and its 400th anniversary was celebrated in 2020. The United States Postal Service issued a new Forever stamp to mark the occasion. The Pilgrims left England due to disagreements with the Church of England. They sailed away to Holland and stayed there for a time. Eventually. they were also persecuted for their faith in this new country. The Pilgrims believed they had no choice but to go to the New World and start fresh. After several delays. they finally began their journey across the Atlantic on September 6. 1620. This was a particularly dangerous time to sail and was known to be the season for strong western gales in the North Atlantic. The Pilgrims sailed Mayflower through several horrific storms on their journey. including one that almost destroyed the ship’s main beam. Luckily. they managed to stabilize the ship. and Mayflower continued sailing. The Pilgrims’ determination and dream of living a life of religious freedom allowed them to overcome dire odds and finally reach America.",

St. Nicholas winking. and a view of him flying across the sky in his sleigh.“A Visit From St. Nicholas” was first published on December 23. 1823. in the?Troy Sentinel?from Troy. New York. ?It was written anonymously at first. but in 1837. Clement Clarke Moore came forward as the author. ?It is said that. as a professor. Moore was initially reluctant to be associated with such a nonacademic piece of writing. ?History says it was his children who finally convinced him to take credit.Today. countless places around the world host readings of “A Visit From St. Nicholas” (often nicknamed “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas”) around the holiday season. ?Oftentimes. the first time children hear the poem is when it’s read by a parent or grandparent. ?The experience creates a lasting memory that sticks with you for all Christmases to come.",

    "description": "Horseshoes. a timeless lawn game with a rich history spanning over 100 years. is typically enjoyed by two players. although team play is also an option. The setup involves placing four horseshoes and two stakes 40 feet apart. The game begins by determining which side throws first. often decided by a toss-off where players from each side throw a single horseshoe. The one landing closer to the stake secures the first turn for their side. The match unfolds with the winning side throwing both of their horseshoes. followed by the opposing side. Two widely used scoring methods. cancellation and count-all. come into play. In cancellation. each side’s total score is calculated for the round. and the higher score subtracts the lower. awarding the point difference to the higher-scoring team. In count-all. every point is tallied. Regardless of the scoring system. the round concludes when one side reaches 15 points. with a full game typically extending to 40 points. Horseshoes gained such popularity by the 1940s that President Harry Truman installed a horseshoe pit at the White House. In 1989. President George H.W. Bush restored the pit. sharing the game with staff. family. and even visiting foreign dignitaries. Horseshoes. with its simple yet engaging nature. is truly accessible to everyone.",

    "description": "With these five Bonsai (Forever) stamps. the U.S. Postal Service celebrates the beauty of bonsai. The word \" bonsai\" (China for \" plant in a pot\" ) refers to the art of cultivating plants. usually trees. in trays. pots. or other containers. Favorite bonsai plants include evergreens. maples. and azaleas. but many other trees and shrubs are also suitable. One of the common styles of bonsai is shown on each of these five stamps. The first stamp depicts a Sierra juniper in a semi-cascade style. in which the tip projects over the pot rim but does not extend below the base. Second is a trident maple in informal upright style. in which the trunk bends slightly to the left or right. The third is a black pine in formal upright style. with the trunk straight and tapering evenly. with symmetrical branches from the base to the apex. Fourth is an azalea plant in multiple-trunk style. with several trunks emerging from one root system. The fifth and final stamp shows a banyan in cascade style. in which the trunk evokes a stream flowing down a mountainside. with the tip extending below the pot\" s base. The plants depicted are roughly 15 to 20 inches tall. The bonsai collection at the National Arboretum began in 1976 when the Nippon Bonsai Association in Tokyo. Japan. presented the people of the United States with 53 plants as part of the U.S. bicentennial commemoration. A bonsai master begins with seeds. cuttings. a naturally stunted tree. or a very young tree. Over time. they prune the roots and branches. use wire to shape and train them. and sometimes scrape or peel bark to achieve desired effects. Finally. the plant is watered and repotted when necessary and can live a hundred years or more. Art director and stamps designer Ethel Kessler worked with artist John D. Dawson on the Bonsai stamps. Forever stamps will always be equal to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce price.",

    "description": "Heritage animals are traditional varieties established over time by our ancestors. Breeding stock for these animals was carefully managed to produce breeds that were adapted to specific environments for specific purposes. They are considered more hardy and require less care than many modern hybrid breeds.In 2021. the United States Postal Service issued a new set of 10 Forever stamps honoring historic heritage breeds. Each design pictures a different animal with its common name listed below. The breeds shown on the stamps are: the Mulefoot hog. Wyandotte chicken. Milking Devon cow. Narragansett turkey. American Mammoth Jackstock donkey. Cotton Patch goose. San Clemente Island goat. American Cream draft horse. Cayuga duck. and Barbados Blackbelly sheep. All of these heritage breeds were established in the Americas.Most of these heritage breeds have few animals of the original breeding stock left today.Howeveer. there is a growing trend for farmers and enthusiasts to bring these special animals back from the brink of extinction.The genetic weaknesses of modern hybrids have also played a role in the resurgance of more sturdy heritage breeds.We can only hope that. with help. they will all be around for generations to come.",

The original 1825 onshore stone tower on Thomas Point was replaced in 1838 due to poor resistance against point erosion. In 1875. Congress opted for a screw-pile light. and Thomas Point Shoal Light was erected. illuminated for the first time in November that year. To secure the structure. cast iron beams drove 12 feet into the bay’s bottom. Enduring considerable battering. winter ice dislodged and destroyed the original lens in 1877. Additional supports were introduced to the screw-pile foundation for stability after lens replacement. By 1964. Thomas Point Shoal Light became the last manned lighthouse in the Chesapeake Bay. automated in 1986. As of 2021. it remained the last unaltered screw-pile cottage-type lighthouse on its original foundation in the Chesapeake Bay. symbolizing Maryland and its rich history.",

She was a star student from an early age and graduated high school at the top of her class. She later attended National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University) and several other schools before traveling to the United States for her PhD. Originally Wu planned to attend the University of Michigan. but changed her mind and instead enrolled at the University of California. Berkeley. Wu thrived in America and earned her PhD in June 1940. Four years later. she joined the Manhattan Project at Columbia University. From there. she became a leading authority in the field of nuclear physics. overcoming prejudices stemming from both her race and gender. Wu continued her research throughout her life. Without Chien-Shiung Wu. we would likely not have the success with nuclear energy that we do today.",

    "description": "Anaxagoras. a philosopher from ancient Greece. was one of the first people in history to offer a scientific explanation of the Sun. He suggested that the Sun wasn’t the chariot of a god. but rather a huge ball of flaming metal. Anaxagoras was also the first to suggest that the Moon glows at night because it is reflecting the light from the sun. After Anaxagoras came to Eratosthenes in the 3rd century BC. and then Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. The latter two began making estimations of how far the Earth was from the Sun. These early astronomers also wondered whether the Sun was the center of the solar system rather than the Earth. However. it wasn’t until Nicolaus Copernicus came along in the 16th century that a detailed model was created to support this theory. Finally. in the 17th century. the telescope was invented. This allowed scientists and philosophers to take the first look at the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere. including the Sun. One of the most famous astronomers to make use of early telescopes was Galileo Galilei. He was the first to theorize that sunspots were located on the surface of the Sun rather than traveling through space as independent objects. Early astronomers provided the foundation of all solar research. Without them. who knows how many mysteries we would’ve missed out on solving",

Stetson in 1865. ?Stetson designed the hat to suit the needs of cowboys and other westerners. ?The very first style was the “Boss of the Plains” hat. which was inspired by a journey to Pike’s Peak. ?These hats were kept their natural color. given four-inch crowns and brims. and a plain band. ?One man said of the hat “It kept the sun out of your eyes and off your neck. ?It was like an umbrella. ?It gave you a bucket (the crown) to water your horse and a cup (the brim) to water yourself. ?It made a hell of a fan. which you need sometimes for a fire but more often to shunt cows this direction or that.” ?The “Boss of the Plains” hat became the model for all future cowboy hat designs \" C from all companies.Stetson’s “Boss of the Plains” soared in popularity and the John B. Stetson Company became a booming business. ?Stetson’s hats were known for their high quality and durability. and were worn by all. ?Other companies eventually produced similar hats. but. to this day.

    "description": "Tales of Santa Claus and St. Nicholas date back hundreds of years. ?But the idea of small elves helping him is a relatively recent creation.Louisa May Alcott is belived to have been the first to mention these elves by name in her 1850 unpublished book.—hristmas Elves. ?In 1857.?Harper’s Weekly?published a lengthy poem called “The Wonders of Santa Claus.” ?The poem referred to elves at work making millions “of pretty things. cakes. sugar-plums. and toys. to fill the stockings” of little girls and boys.The poem helped to popularize the idea. and in 1873. an illustration on the cover of?Godey’s Lady’s Book?presented one of the first depictions of Santa and his elves. ?Illustrations in Austin Thompson’s 1876?The House of Santa Claus?also helped familiarize people with Christmas elves. ?And in the 1920s. famed painter Norman Rockwell depicted Santa and his elves rushing to get a dollhouse built in time for Christmas.It wasn’t long before elves made the leap to the big screen. ?Most famously. in the 1964 film?Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. one of the main characters is an elf named Hermey who wants to be a dentist.In the 2000s. elf popularity skyrocketed with the introduction of the Elf on a Shelf doll. ?Developed from a family tradition. these elves visit homes during the holidays and report back to Santa.",

Webb. administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968. ?It was designed as a successor to the famous Hubble Space Telescope and features improvements to allow for higher resolutiona nd better images. ?It is hoped the Webb telescope will give astronomers the chance to investigate some of the oldest stars and galaxies in the universe from the safety of planet Earth.The Hubble Space Telescope was smaller than JWST and observed objects in ultraviolet. visible. and near-infrared light. ?JWST. on the other hand. observes objects in a lower frequency range from long-wave visible (red) light through mid-infrared. ?It is equipped with a powerful kite-shaped sunshield to keep direct light from the Sun and indirect light from the Moon and Earth from hitting it. ?This was done to keep the telescope at the extremely cold temperature (50 Kelvin or -370 oF) required to keep it functioning. ?JWST orbits the Sun at 930.000 miles from Earth.JWST was supposed to launch in 2007. but was delayed by unforeseen circumstances (including the COVID-19 pandemic. which began in 2020). ?The telescope finally launched in December 2021. marking the beginning of a new era in space imaging.",

Sell on Monday.” these races helped increase sales across the country. ?Before long. enthusiastic drivers were staging their own street races. testing out the pony cars’ abilities for themselves.",

God. and more. ?The flag is folded twice lengthwise. making sure the stars on the blue field remain outward. ?The third fold begins a series of triangle folds ending with the remaining portion of the flag neatly tucked in. ?The final shape is meant to remind us of the three-corner hat popular during the Revolutionary War and the beginning of our great country.Our flag is more than just a symbol of our country. ?It is a symbol of the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe… and free.",

It is a time to prepare for a fresh start while honoring the past. … It is an occasion to welcome good luck and prosperity.\" said Ronald A. Stroman. a member of the USPS Board of Governors. who served as the stamp ceremony\" s dedicating official. He was joined by Michelle Yun. vice president of global artistic programs and director of the Asia Society Museum. and Anne del Castillo. commissioner of the New York City Mayor\" s Office of Media and Entertainment. \" Lunar New Year is a time when Asians and Asian Americans honor their cultural heritage and traditions. and this stamp series celebrates their prominence and influence on U.S. history and culture.\" del Castillo said. The Year of the Tiger begins Feb. 1. 2022 and ends Jan. 21. 2023. The tiger is the third of the 12 zodiac animal signs associated with the Chinese lunar calendar. Many ancient fables and legends explain the origin of the zodiac signs. The most common story tells of the animals racing across a river to determine their order in the cycle. The rat crossed by riding on the back of the ox. jumping ahead at the last minute to win the race. Next came the ox. then the tiger. rabbit. dragon. snake. horse. ram. monkey. rooster and dog. followed by the boar in last place. As with other zodiac signs. personality traits and other attributes are often associated with people born in the year of a particular animal. Those born during the Year of the Tiger may be seen as brave. confident and well-liked by others. Blue. orange and gray are lucky colors for tigers. and yellow lilies and cineraria may also bring good luck. Other predictions about important milestones in life are often made based on a person\" s zodiac animal sign. including romantic compatibility. career trajectory and health prospects. Lunar New Year is one of the most important holidays of the year for many Asian communities around the world. including in the United States. China. Vietnam. South Korea and Singapore. Across these varied cultures. many traditions exist for ringing in a new year of good luck and prosperity. Known as Tet in Vietnam and the Spring Festival in China and elsewhere. Lunar New Year begins on the second new moon after the winter solstice and historically marks the arrival of spring. Filled with symbolic meaning. the colors red and gold appear everywhere during this auspicious time of year. Red is considered very lucky. while gold is supposed to bring wealth. In the first few days of the new year. parades and pageants are common with dancers. acrobats and musicians. The festivities also mark a major occasion for folk artists making paper-cut crafts for celebration. Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on the night of the first full moon after New Year\" s Eve. known as the Lantern Festival in Chinese culture. In the United States and elsewhere. the festival is marked with grand parades and brilliant lanterns decorating public spaces. In observance of this holiday. the U.S. Postal Service introduced its third series of Lunar New Year stamps in 2020. This new series will continue through 2031 with stamps for the Year of the Rabbit. Dragon. Snake. Horse. Ram. Monkey. Rooster. Dog and Boar still to come. Art director Antonio Alcal\" \" worked on the series of stamps with artist Camille Chew to create Lunar New Year imagery that is fresh. fun and celebratory. Calling to mind the elaborately decorated masks used in the dragon or lion dances often performed during Lunar New Year parades. Chew\" s three-dimensional masks are a contemporary take on the long tradition of paper-cut folk art crafts created during this auspicious time of year.",

    "description": "SAN DIEGO ?a The U.S. Postal Service has issued a high-denomination stamp celebrating the mathematical symmetry of flowers. A dedication for the stamp was held today at the San Diego Stamp Show. The new $10 Floral Geometry stamp complements similar $2 and $5 stamps issued in 2022. These stamps lend a contemporary appearance to packages. large envelopes and other mailings. The Floral Geometry stamps began as an exploration of the patterns found in nature. specifically the symmetry of flowers. The designs feature a series of overlapping geometric shapes ?a circles. ovals and triangles ?a that reflect the symmetry of floral patterns. As the stamp denominations rise from $2 to $5 to $10. the designs become more complex. The watercolor backgrounds were painted by hand and scanned. The background for the $10 stamp is red; white geometric lines and typography were added digitally. A foil treatment adds a stylish glimmer. The stamps were designed and created by the firm Spaeth Hill. Antonio Alcal\" \" was the art director.",

    "description": "Adding a vital African American voice to American literature. Ernest J. Gaines brought worldwide attention to generations of men and women who asserted their own dignity in the face of racial oppression and violence. Gaines was born on Riverlake Plantation in the town of Oscar just outside New Roads. LA. where his family had lived in the former slave quarters for five generations. He moved to California in 1948. but for decades afterward. his fiction reflected a deep and unbreakable connection to the rural Louisiana of his youth. After serving in the Army for two years and graduating from college. Gaines received a prestigious fellowship in 1958 to study creative writing at Stanford University. He published his first novel. \" Catherine Carmier.\" in 1964. but he achieved true fame. widespread acclaim. and a Pulitzer Prize nomination in 1971 with \" The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.\" a novel chronicling the recollections of its 110-year-old African American protagonist. whose life spans slavery to the civil rights era. In 1981. Gaines took a position teaching creative writing at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana) and soon became its writer-in-residence. In 1983. he published the novel \" A Gathering of Old Men.\" about a group of African American men who assert their humanity and pride in the face of long-standing prejudice and violence. In 1993. Gaines published his most critically and popularly acclaimed novel. \" A Lesson Before Dying.\" about a college-educated African American teacher who provides education and inspiration to a young farmhand awaiting execution for murder. Over the course of their difficult visits in prison. they form a bond that shows both the need to resist those who would deny them their dignity and self-respect. In addition to earning the National Book Critics Circle Award. \" A Lesson Before Dying\" resulted in Gaines receiving a prestigious MacArthur Foundation \" genius grant.\" In 2013. Gaines accepted the National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama. calling it the greatest honor he had ever received. Today the Baton Rouge Area Foundation continues to endow an annual Ernest J. Gaines Award for Literary Excellence. which recognizes African American fiction writers who are just beginning to rise to national prominence. Mike Ryan designed the stamp with art by Robert Peterson. Greg Breeding served as art director. The Ernest J. Gaines Black Heritage stamp is being issued as a Forever stamp.

    "description": "\" For more than three decades. the Postal Service has issued stamps highlighting the Lunar New Year. and they are some of the most successful stamp releases in our history. This is an important celebration for many Asian people. with an estimated 1.5 billion people around the world marking this special occasion.\" said Derek Kan. a member of the USPS Board of Governors. who served as the dedicating official. \" As we use this stamp in the weeks ahead. let us reflect on the American journey. and the millions of Asian Americans who have helped walk it.\" Other participants at the ceremony were London N.

This year. we are excited to be the city to introduce the release of the Year of the Rabbit Commemorative Forever Stamp.\" said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. \" As we look forward to preparing for and celebrating the arrival of spring. this stamp symbolizes our continued commitment to working with one another not only during this time of the year but all year round.\" The Year of the Rabbit begins Jan. 22 and ends on Feb. 9. 2024. Lunar New Year is an important holiday for many Asian communities around the world. It is primarily celebrated by people of Chinese. Korean. Vietnamese. Tibetan. Mongolian. Malaysian and Filipino heritage. Across these varied cultures. many traditions exist for ringing in a new year of good luck and prosperity. Parades and pageants are common with dancers. acrobats and musicians. Personality traits and attributes are often associated with people born in the year of a particular animal. Those born in rabbit years are said to be elegant. graceful and kind. Pink. red and purple are lucky colors for rabbits. and plantain lilies are also said to be fortunate. Romantic compatibility. career trajectory and health prospects are also believed to be linked to one\" s birth sign. Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on the night of the first full moon after Lunar New Year\" s Eve. known as the Lantern Festival in Chinese culture. In the United States and elsewhere. the festival is marked with grand parades and brilliant lanterns decorating public spaces. \" At the Asian Art Museum. our mission is to share a broader. richer and more inclusive story of the diverse America we live in today.” said Jay Xu. the Barbara Bass Bakar director and CEO of the Asian Art Museum. “Hope characterizes the Year of the Rabbit in 2023 ?a and it fills me with hope to unveil this unique Lunar New Year stamp at our museum. and to showcase the power of art everywhere to help tell that special story with beauty and joy.\" In observance of this holiday. the Postal Service introduced its third series of Lunar New Year stamps in 2020. This latest series will continue through 2031 with stamps for the Year of the Dragon. Snake. Horse. Ram. Monkey. Rooster. Dog and Boar still to come. Art director Antonio Alcal\" \" worked on the stamp design with artist Camille Chew to create imagery that is fresh. fun and celebratory. Calling to mind the elaborately decorated masks used in the dragon or lion dances often performed during Lunar New Year parades. Chew\" s three-dimensional masks are a contemporary take on the long tradition of paper-cut folk-art crafts created during this auspicious time of year. The Lunar New Year stamp is available in panes of 20.",

    "description": "This new 20-stamp pane from the U.S. Postal Service celebrates NASA\" s seven-year OSIRIS-REx mission to study and map the asteroid Bennu and return a sample of the surface to Earth in September 2023. This is the first pristine sample of an asteroid collected by the United States. and it will help scientists learn how our solar system formed. The stamp artwork shows the capsule containing the sample parachuting to the Utah Test and Training Range. a U.S. Department of Defense facility in the desert. A depiction of Bennu\" s surface appears at the bottom of the pane\" s selvage with outer space above ?a deep blue and dappled with celestial bodies. A view of the asteroid is in the upper right corner. OSIRIS-REx left Earth aboard a rocket launched from Cape Canaveral. FL. on Sept. 8. 2016. then orbited the sun for a year before passing close to Earth for a gravity assist. The spacecraft arrived in the asteroid\" s vicinity in December 2018 and got to work. With its special cameras and spectrometers. it began photographing and mapping Bennu\" s surface to determine the best site from which to collect samples. The time for the rendezvous arrived in October 2020. To carry out its task. the spacecraft did not actually land on the asteroid but instead slowly descended toward the surface and extended a robotic arm. A collection device at the hand-end of the arm then released a sudden puff of nitrogen gas that sent up a cloud of dust and rocks from Bennu\" s surface. More than 2 ounces of these materials were captured in a special container in the collection device. which then closed and retracted into the spacecraft. On May 10. 2021. OSIRIS-REx began its flight back toward Earth. Its container of asteroid dust and rocks. enclosed in a special capsule. will parachute to the Utah desert on Sept. 24. 2023. Alan Dingman illustrated the stamp and pane. basing his work on images supplied by NASA. Antonio Alcal\" \" . an art director for USPS. designed the stamp and pane.",

    "description": "The USPS issued the stamp to commemorate the tradition of pi?atas in Mexican culture. The stamp design features colorful digital illustrations of traditional pi?ata designs. including donkeys and seven-point stars. The artwork is by Victor Mel\" ndez. The First Day of Issue Ceremony took place in Roswell. New Mexico. during the 36th annual Pi?ata Festival. Pi?atas are a popular feature at celebrations. bringing joy with their bright colors. fun shapes. and treats inside. In 2023. the USPS released a set of four stamps depicting traditional Mexican pi?atas. The star and donkey are the most popular pi?ata shapes in Mexico. introduced in the 1500s by Spanish missionaries. These missionaries used pi?atas to connect with the locals. incorporating shapes representing aspects of the Nativity. The star symbolizes the Star of Bethlehem and the seven deadly sins. while the donkey represents the burro Mary rode to the manger. Early pi?atas were clay pots adorned with colorful feathers and paper. filled with fruit and sugar cane. Over time. cardboard and papier-mach\" replaced clay pots. Today. most pi?atas are filled with candy but can include toys. fruit. or other items. Since 2006. Mexico’s Museum of Folk Art has hosted an annual pi?ata contest celebrating their history and artistry. The museum also conducts pi?ata workshops and features pi?atas in its permanent collections. In 2022. Philadelphia built the world’s largest pi?ata. standing 61 feet tall. 60 feet long. 23 feet wide. and holding 8.000 pounds of candy!",

    "description": "Sold in panes of 20 and in self-adhesive coils of 3.000 and 10.000. the Red Fox stamp is intended for use by bulk mailers for items such as circulars. newsletters and catalogs. It can also be used by customers who enjoy using a variety of stamps on their envelopes and packages. This new stamp features a pencil-and-watercolor illustration of a red fox. The handsome face of this wild canid is from preexisting artwork by Dugald Stermer (1936\" C2011). Stermer masterfully captured the fox\" s softness. striking coloration and gaze toward the viewer. His calligraphic labels in the stamp\" s white background. under the animal\" s face and between its alert ears. provide the common and scientific names. respectively: \" RED FOX.\" in widely spaced capitals. and \" Vulpes vulpes.\" In tan. centered below the artwork. the stamp reads \" 40c USA.\" in a sans-serif typeface. Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamp. The range of the red fox covers almost all of the United States. including Alaska. This wild canid is absent only from Hawaii and parts of the Southwest. Highly adaptable. foxes are found not only in woodlands and open country but also in suburbs and cities. where they have learned to scavenge for a wide variety of food. Fox species can be found over much of the Earth. and the red fox is the widest ranging. Although the red fox can also be colored gray or white. it is named for its most common rusty coloration. This pigmentation typically includes darker forelegs and white fur both on the animal\" s underside and on the tip of its bushy tail. In chilly weather. the tail. or brush. serves as a comforter when the fox curls up to sleep. Foxes often rest during the day and hunt at night. Red foxes are versatile omnivores. They favor rabbits and other rodents and also partake of birds. fish. insects and invertebrates. as well as nuts. roots. berries and more.",

    "description": "In the early days. the only way most children could get to school was by walking. Halfway through the 19th century. that began to change with the introduction of \"kid hacks.\" These were horse-drawn carriages designed to carry children to school. They were primitive and didn’t have much protection from the elements. but they marked the beginning of the history of school buses. The first \"horseless\" school bus was produced by Wayne Works in 1914. Five years later. the use of school buses was funded in all 48 US states. Buses went through a number of innovations in the next twenty years or so. By the 1930s. the design had pretty much settled to the style we know today. It was also around this time that \"National School Bus Glossy Yellow\" became the standard color for all school buses. As the years passed. more safety features were added. making today’s school buses some of the safest vehicles on the roads. In fact. according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board. riding a school bus is more than 70 times safer than riding in a regular car. That’s good news for the over 27 million American children who travel to and from school by bus every day!",

    "description": "In many parts of the United States. autumn rivals spring as the most resplendent time of year. thanks to the rich palette of reds. yellows and oranges that bursts onto the landscape every fall. The Postal Service celebrates this radiant annual display with its Autumn Colors stamps. As days shorten and summer’s warmth begins to fade. the trees around us prepare for the biochemical changes that will soon transform their bright green foliage into the golden ochres. flaming vermilions and burnt oranges so characteristic of autumn. During spring and summer. leaves appear green due to the continuous creation of chlorophyll. a result of photosynthesis. As the light diminishes and nights become crisper. photosynthesis begins to slow and finally stops altogether. Leaves lose their green color and reveal carotenoids. yellow and orange pigments that were present all year but masked by the abundant chlorophyll. Sunny. warm days and cool nights also trigger the production of anthocyanins. the vibrant red and purple pigments observed in trees such as the black gum. red maple and sumac. The pane of 20 stamps shows a portfolio of 10 brilliant photographs taken by renowned nature and garden photographer Allen Rokach (1941—2021). Rokach often used what he called the \"Rokach effect.\" a technique that gives photos an impressionistic cast. In addition to the classic autumn colors of orange. red and yellow. the photographs show flashes of vermilion. ocher. violet and cobalt in different landscapes. There are many places across the United States to experience autumn leaves in all their glory. New England. where weather conditions provide the optimal environment for the range of intense colors. attracts millions of \"leaf-peepers\" each fall. and the Blue Ridge Parkway and Maryland’s Eastern Shore follow the patterns of their leaf cousins in the northeast. Other places with spectacular fall color include Aspen. CO. named for the golden aspens that surround this Rocky Mountain town; Taos. NM. and surrounding desert; the Great Smoky Mountains; and the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon. Ethel Kessler. an art director for USPS. designed the stamps with existing photographs by Allen Rokach.",

    "description": "The stamp design was unveiled at the White House by First Lady Jill Biden. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Susan Ford Bales. daughter of former President Gerald R. Ford and former First Lady Betty Ford. The dedication ceremony for the Forever stamp will be held April 5 ?a three days before the 106th anniversary of her birth. The event will take place at the Annenberg Health Sciences Building located at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage. CA. \" Betty Ford changed the role of first lady.\" said Postmaster General DeJoy. \" She used the role not just as a platform to represent the nation and advance and support her husband. she used it to speak openly and honestly about issues she cared about. and about personal issues she faced.\" Elizabeth Anne Bloomer Ford (1918\" C2011). wife of the 38th president. was first lady of the United States from 1974 to 1977. After the Watergate scandal forced the resignation of President Richard Nixon on Aug. 9. 1974. and an earlier scandal pushed out Vice President Spiro Agnew. Gerald Ford became the first U.S. president who had never been elected president or vice president. In her new role as first lady. Betty Ford. impressed the American public in interviews by showing humor and frankness about controversial issues facing the country. \" Mom would be humbled and grateful beyond words for the extraordinary tribute of her commemorative stamp.\" said daughter Susan Ford Bales. who attended the White House event. \" To?Mom. the stamp would be a?heartwarming?reminder of joys of millions of breast cancer and substance use disorder survivors who have overcome their diseases?and?individually added to her?legacy of candor and courage.\" While the Fords never intended to inhabit the White House. Betty Ford embraced the role. becoming the most politically outspoken first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt and helping mold the position\" s modern role. Throughout her husband\" s political career. Mrs. Ford openly fought for women\" s rights. often conflicting with the Republican Party\" s stances. She campaigned tirelessly for the Equal Rights Amendment. which would have mandated constitutional equality for all Americans. regardless of gender. After being diagnosed with breast cancer. Mrs. Ford underwent a mastectomy on Sept. 28. 1974. While medical issues of previous first ladies weren\" t always disclosed. Mrs. Ford chose to share the story of her treatment for the once-taboo medical condition. In 1964. Mrs. Ford had begun taking prescription pain pills for a pinched nerve in her neck. developing a substance use disorder over time. In 1978. after an intervention. she entered the Naval Regional Medical Hospital in Long Beach. CA. for treatment. As with her breast cancer. she publicly acknowledged her substance use disorder. changing its perception and putting a face to the disease. In 1982. Mrs. Ford and former ambassador and close family friend Leonard Firestone established the Betty Ford Center for substance dependency. She agreed to lend her name to the center. hoping to destigmatize substance use disorder treatment at a time when it wasn\" t spoken about openly ?a especially by women ?a and options for treatment were scarce. Her work helped change the way treatment options and those seeking it are viewed by American society.",

    "description": "Born in the mid-20th century. bluegrass defies time. drawing inspiration from the past while also openly embracing innovation. At once rural and urban. emotional and highly technical. this singular American music style remains unconstrained by geography. attracting fans worldwide who all share the same passion for what they affectionately call the \" high lonesome sound.\" Inspired by vintage bluegrass concert posters. the stamp art features four acoustic string instruments typical of bluegrass bands: guitar. five-string banjo. fiddle. and mandolin. Text at the top of the stamp reads \" High Lonesome Sound.\" the title of a 1963 documentary about Appalachian folk music and a familiar nickname for bluegrass. The five-string banjo dominates the sound of bluegrass and. along with guitar. mandolin. and bass. sets the rhythmic foundation of this often fast-paced music. Fiddle. mandolin. banjo. and guitar evoke a range of melodic flavors and emotions in their solos and backup. Instrumental dexterity. combined with tight vocal harmonies and heartfelt. sometimes mournful lyrics. creates an electrifying and emotional experience for both performers and listeners. Music historians generally agree that bluegrass as we know it originated with Bill Monroe (1911\" C1996). who drew on old-time fiddle and church music as well as gospel. blues. and jazz to fashion a style of music that was both brand-new and achingly familiar. By 1945. Monroe and his band. the Blue Grass Boys. had solidified the key components of bluegrass: refined vocal harmonies. driving tempos. and outstanding musicianship. Once viewed as a type of country music. bluegrass?awhich musicologist Alan Lomax famously described as \" folk music with overdrive\" ?aemerged as its own distinct genre in the 1950s. Soon the music could be found just about everywhere. from college campuses and large urban areas to television shows and movies. Outdoor festivals became a mainstay of bluegrass in the 1970s. a period when the music took off in new directions as bands eagerly incorporated influences from rock and pop. Today. although bluegrass enjoys relatively little radio exposure. the music continues to thrive. The nonprofit International Bluegrass Music Association was founded in 1985. a bluegrass category was added to the Grammy Awards in 1989. and the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame was founded in Owensboro. Kentucky. in 1991.?Billboard?launched its bluegrass albums chart in 2002. two years after the wildly popular soundtrack to the film?O Brother. Where Art Thou\" introduced bluegrass to yet another generation of fans. Today. bluegrass festivals held around the world. like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado and Bluegrass Live! in North Carolina. draw thousands of fans every year.",

The nondenominated (73\" ) Christmas Madonna and Child stamp features an oil-on-canvas painting by the workshop of Sassoferrato (1609—85). an Italian artist. According to the Postal Service. \"he and his workshop produced many versions of this painting.\" \"The artwork depicts a watchful Madonna. her head tilted toward the sleeping Christ child nestled against her. She wears a blue cloak and a dark red gown. from which off-white undersleeves emerge at the elbows. A beige veil. reminiscent of a halo. covers part of her light brown hair. Her child appears partially swaddled in beige cloth.\" the Postal Service said. Sassoferrato himself was credited specifically as the artist for the Christmas stamp (Scott 4424) issued in 2009. When asked about the selection of this painting for the new Christmas stamp. designer Breeding told Linn’s: \"Our research agency constantly researches Madonna and Child images on display in American museums. As we pore through the images. we are often drawn to those from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. These images. like this Sassoferrato workshop painting. are life-like and offer a sense of the tenderness and warmth between mother and child.\"",

    "description": "Celebrate the holidays with four stamps from the U.S. Postal Service. These festive. folk art-inspired stamps are sure to enliven your 2024 holiday mailings. With a color palette including red. green. blue. pink. yellow. and white. illustrator Michelle Mu?oz channeled her love of Christmas. vintage ornaments. and Mexican folk art to create unique images of holiday decor: two traditionally shaped ornaments ready to hang; a vibrant poinsettia surrounded by greenery; and a whimsical blue flower centered against green leaves and delicate scrollwork. Evergreen trees and flowering plants have been a part of winter and seasonal festivities for thousands of years. Firs and other foliage that stayed green during those long. dark days provided hope and comfort to pagan celebrants by reminding them that summer and sunlight would eventually return. Over time. Christians made the tradition of using greenery at winter celebrations their own: the first recorded mention of decorated fir trees came from early 17th-century Germany. Glass ornaments appeared in Germany in the mid-1800s. spreading to the United States and many other countries by the end of the 19th century. Mass produced. commercial tree decorations are ubiquitous today. but unique. hand-blown or handcrafted baubles are still produced by small companies in America and Europe. Unlike holiday tree ornaments. the iconic poinsettia did not arrive in the United States by way of Europe. Native to Mexico. where it can grow 10 feet tall or more. the poinsettia is the one of the most popular potted plants in the United States today with more than 34 million poinsettias sold each year. It has been associated with Christmas here since the 19th century.",

Vital to the early economic development of the United States. they are now beloved companions and valued for their roles in sport and recreation. The U.S. Postal Service celebrates the timeless beauty of these remarkable animals with five stamps. The selvage showcases a chestnut horse with a black muzzle and mane peering out of a Dutch barn window. Three of the horses featured on the stamps appear in their natural environments against a background of green foliage: a gray-maned dappled white mare; a horse with a russet coat. a copper mane. and white facial markings; and a golden chestnut with a chalky white mane. A horse with a brown spotted coat and light-colored mane is standing against a snowy wooded background. A chestnut horse with a white blaze is photographed against a simple black background.\" The direct ancestors of the modern horse disappeared on the North American continent more than 6000 years ago along with other megafauna such as the woolly mammoth and the American camel. Fortunately. horses had crossed over the Bering land bridge into Asia enabling them to survive as a species and eventually allowing their return to the Western Hemisphere. Spanish conquistadors brought domesticated horses with them to the Americas in the 16th century. These Spanish horses were a key factor in the conquistadors’ subjugation of the indigenous populations in the New World. Many Native American tribes realized the immense value of horses. and they became an integral part of their culture and society. The use of horses spread across the forests and plains of North America over the next 200 years. Breeds such as the Quarter Horse. the Morgan. the American Paint. and the American Saddlebred were created to meet the increasing demand for horses used for specific purposes such as pulling carriages and riding. As the United States developed into a modern nation. horses played critical roles in transportation. farming. manufacturing. and mining. The mass production of the automobile. however. brought major changes to how horses were utilized in transportation. Mechanization and electrification further spurred the disintegration of the horse industry and by the early 1960s. the horse population had dwindled to a low of approximately three million. The number of horses in the U.S. has more than doubled since then. Along with horse racing and riding. horses today are used in law enforcement. forestry. entertainment. equine therapy. and cattle ranching.",

Having recreated images first captured by NASA\" s Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 and 2014 using Webb in mid-infrared light. astronomers are using this new image to build a deeper understanding of this star-forming region. The image on the stamp is a digitally colored depiction of the invisible bands of mid-infrared light emitted by the Pillars of Creation. By assigning color to various infrared wavelengths. the digitized image allows us to see a landscape otherwise invisible to the human eye. Red areas toward the end of the pillars show burgeoning stars ejecting raw materials as they form. while the relatively small red orbs scattered throughout the image show newly born stars. Some of that same material may coalesce into new planets. Launched on December 25. 2021. NASA\" s James Webb Space Telescope is the largest and most sensitive telescope ever deployed in space. Revealing the cosmos in vivid infrared detail. it is designed to provide scientists with breathtaking images and new data.

    "description": "For more than 100 million years. the ancestors of marine turtles swam the oceans. Yet in less than a century. exploitation and habitat destruction have devastated their numbers. The U.S. Postal Service celebrates the protection of these intriguing creatures with six stamps. featuring species dependent on U.S. coastal waters for foraging and migratory habitats during various stages of their lives. All six turtles are listed and protected under the Endangered Species Act. The stamps showcase a gray-green Kemp’s ridley (Doug Perrine. photographer); a black and white leatherback (Rowan Byrne. photographer); an olive ridley (Solvin Zankl. photographer); a green sea turtle (David B. Fleetham. photographer); a mottled orange-brown loggerhead (James D. Watt. photographer); and a brownish-yellow hawksbill (Claudio Contreras. photographer). The selvage features another hawksbill sea turtle (Reinhard Dirscherl. photographer). To the right of this photo are the names of the species written in upper-case. white letters. At the lower left of each stamp. the common name of the species is printed vertically upward in white. The issuance title \"PROTECT SEA TURTLES\" appears in large. white type against a dark blue background to the left of the stamps. One of the oldest groups of animals on Earth. sea turtles spend most of their lives at sea. coming ashore only to lay their eggs. and in some places to bask. They migrate long distances. sometimes crossing entire oceans. Sea turtles are found in U.S. waters from the Gulf of Mexico to New England. along the West Coast. and in Hawaii. the Caribbean. and the South Pacific. Along the southeastern coast. most nesting occurs from Florida to North Carolina. and each summer this area hosts the largest assemblage of nesting loggerheads in the world. In addition to loggerheads. leatherbacks and green sea turtles regularly nest on U.S. beaches. whereas hawksbill and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles nest in fewer numbers. Though olive ridleys do not nest in the U.S.. they do forage in waters of Hawaii and the southwestern U.S.. sometimes north to the Oregon coast. Sea turtles face numerous threats worldwide. but there are many things that individuals can do directly to help sea turtles. Become a responsible seafood consumer by asking where and how seafood was caught. Choose seafood caught in ways that do not harm or kill turtles. Consult sustainable seafood information networks to learn about how and where seafood is caught. These simple precautions can make a world of difference in protecting these magnificent creatures.",

Bellow considered himself a historian of American identity. populating his books with dreamers and intellectuals searching for meaning in a materialistic. sometimes disorienting world. The subtle analysis of modern culture and immigrant experience woven through Bellow\" s writings combined fierce social criticism with a comic gusto that drew in readers. Widely regarded as one of the greatest authors of the 20th century. Bellow was the recipient of a record three National Book Awards. a Nobel Prize and a Pulitzer Prize. The stamp features a portrait of the author with a Chicago street scene in the background. He wears a fedora. white turtleneck and dark jacket. Behind him are skyscrapers. with the \" L\" train running between the buildings. The title \" Saul Bellow\" is in dark purple letters in the upper-right corner. with \" Three Ounce\" and \" USA\" appearing vertically along the left side. Ethel Kessler. an art director for USPS. designed the stamp. with original art by illustrator Joe Ciardiello based on photographs from 1982. To keep the writer\" s image as the focal point. the artist painted much of the background in neutral colors using a pale-yellow wash and some brownish-grays and a bit of purple. The words \" THREE OUNCE\" on this stamp indicate its usage value. meaning that it may be used on a mail piece weighing three ounces. Like a Forever? stamp. it will always be valid for the rate printed on it.",

    "description": "The?Save Manatees?stamp is being issued to create awareness about the threats posed to this beloved marine mammal. Human vigilance is crucial for the protection of the threatened West Indian manatee?aboth to minimize motorboat strikes and to maintain the aquatic plants on which it feeds. The gentle West Indian manatee?inhabits warm inland waterways in Florida and warm areas of the coastal Atlantic. Caribbean. and Gulf of Mexico. The Florida manatee. present year-round in the state\" s rivers and springs. is one of two subspecies of West Indian manatee. The stamp\" s stylized artwork. predominantly aqua-colored. shows a manatee underwater. placidly lolling near the surface. These slow-swimming marine mammals hungrily feed on shallow-water aquatic plants. eating up to 10 percent of their body weight each day. An adult West Indian manatee typically weighs about 1.000 to 1.500 pounds and is about eight to 11 feet long. Its prehensile lips and its sensitive. flexible whiskers help the manatee guide its leafy meals to its mouth. The manatee\" s busy feeding schedule is interrupted by frequent underwater naps. during which the animal surfaces to breathe every 10 minutes or so?amore often when actively swimming. Florida manatees thrive in water of 68\" F or warmer. Their summer range reaches the coastal Carolinas?afarther north on occasion. Manatees have no natural predators but are slow to reproduce. A female manatee gives birth to one offspring at a time. nursing for several months before the calf starts eating plants. A mother may tend to her young for up to about two years. communicating with touches. nuzzling \" kisses\" and sounds including chirps. squeaks. and squeals. West Indian Manatee populations have rebounded from lows of only several hundred individuals in the 1970s. In 2017. its status under the Endangered Species Act was upgraded from?endangered to threatened. Although thousands of West Indian Manatees exist today. surging numbers of die-offs have recently raised alarm. Toxic algae blooms. worsened by pollution. kill seagrass. In recent years. this loss of manatees\" primary food resources has led to starvation. Collisions with fast-moving watercraft can also prove fatal; almost all grown manatees bear scars from boat propellers. This docile creature benefits from watercraft speed limits. refuge areas. and heightened awareness of manatee vulnerability. To help protect Florida\" s official marine mammal. many residents purchase \" Save the Manatee\" license plates. raising funds for conservation and increasing awareness.",

Four stamps show the U.S. flag majestically waving at different times of the day. While the shapes and colors of the clouds change. the sun is always shining on the flag. The flags. shown from a low-angle perspective. draw attention upward. toward the magic of the sky. The illustrator painted the designs using gouache on illustration board. Stars and Stripes on the U.S. flag’s design date to June 14. 1777. when the Continental Congress specified 13 horizontal stripes and 13 stars to honor the original colonies. The 13 stripes have appeared on every version of the flag except from 1795\" C1818. when there were 15 stripes for the 15 states in the Union. The Flag Act of 1818 standardized the number of stripes as 13 and stipulated that a star would be added for each new state. In 1916. Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation establishing June 14 as Flag Day. which was officially designated by Congress in 1949. Since the first flag. there have been 27 versions as more states have entered the Union. The current flag was created when Hawai\" i was added as the 50th state in 1959. with the 50-star flag debuting on July 4. 1960. The current design is the longest used in the country\" s history.",

The top third of each stamp features a sepia-toned portrait. Below it are several lines of text with the words: BLACK/WHITE. COOPERATION. TRUST/DANGER. FLIGHT/FAITH. COURAGE/RISK. DEFIANCE/HOPE. and UNDERGROUND RAILROAD/USA. From the time slavery was introduced to the Colonies until it was abolished in 1865. enslaved people made ceaseless efforts to escape its reach. The flight to freedom \" whether by foot. horseback. carriage. wagon or boat \" was difficult and exceedingly dangerous.In name only. the Underground Railroad started as a loosely organized secret network of courageous and imaginative freedom seekers. and the brave operatives who assisted them. It was powered not by coal but by human courage. As railroads grew in the 1830s and 1840s. the secret network adopted their terminology. \"Stationmasters\" and \"conductors\" assisted \"passengers\" traveling from one \"station\" to another on the Underground Railroad. Over time. the network coalesced into a well-organized system as it responded to the increasing numbers of freedom seekers and a corresponding rise in attempts to thwart escapes. Most remained anonymous. but some left their mark on history. including the 10 men and women honored on these Forever stamps: Harriet Tubman. Thomas Garrett. William Still. Harriet Jacobs. Jermain Loguen. Catherine Coffin. Lewis Hayden. Frederick Douglass. William Lambert. and Laura Haviland. In 1863. President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. liberating all enslaved people. In 1865. following the end of the Civil War. the 13th Amendment was ratified. abolishing slavery throughout the country.",

    "description": "The cute appearance of animal babies reminds us of an innocent. vulnerable time of life when the world is new and full of wonder. Eye-popping and endearing graphic illustrations represent the young of 10 creatures that range widely across the United States: fox. owl. deer. seal. rabbit. bear. skunk. bobcat. chipmunk. and raccoon. The clever fox can prosper in remote wilderness and urban areas. A fox vixen generally bears four or five kits as winter turns to spring. The family stays together through the summer. and the mother removes her frisky young from harm’s way. carrying each kit by the scruff of the neck. Young owls develop the soft wing feathers that they will need to fly in silent stealth. The owlets flap their wings to practice for flight. A mother signals her fledglings with calls and bill-snapping. Owls rely on their keen senses of sight and hearing for night hunting. Minutes after birth. a deer fawn can walk on its spindly legs. The young are often left alone by their mother. who makes brief visits several times a day to nurse. Virtually scent-free. fawns keep still and quiet. Dappled camouflage also makes detection difficult. A seal pup gains weight quickly on its mother’s rich milk. The resulting thick layer of blubber will help the pup survive in the cold ocean. The young seal knows to close its nostrils and ear openings as it learns to make deep dives to feed on fish and other sea creatures. Helpless at birth. young rabbits develop quickly in a shallow den padded with grass and their mother’s soft fur. After a few weeks nursing. the active little bunnies nibble grasses and herbs. A young rabbit develops long hind legs to allow for quick escapes from approaching danger. A mother bear gives birth during winter torpor. a hibernation-like time of rest. Cubs. often twins. grow quickly on milk and an omnivorous diet including roots. berries. honey. insects. fish. and other meat. Fairly self-sufficient at about six months. a cub might stay with its mom for up to three years. Baby skunks are typically born inside a hollow log. a leafy nest. or a burrow. The distinct striped or spotted pattern is evident on bare skin before fur grows in. Growing skunks practice foot-stomping and handstands \" warnings to alert wise predators before the infamous stinky spray ever becomes necessary. A bobcat mother. shy and elusive. typically bears two or three kittens in a cave or a hollow log. Mom brings rodents and birds as meals. As the kittens grow. she teaches them to stalk and pounce on prey. They may stay with her for as long as a year. Chipmunks. cute and curious. are small. striped members of the squirrel family. The young are born in a nest within extensive underground burrows dug or inherited by their families. After a month. the pups emerge to eagerly scamper about the ground during the spring and summer. A mother raccoon tends to her newborns. often in a nest high in a tree. Once they are ready to explore \" or whenever caution demands it \" she might carry them to a new nest on the ground. They become more independent in summer. yet the raccoon mom watches over her young for a year or so. Tracy Walker was the stamp designer and artist. Greg Breeding was the art director.",

Goodnight Moon revolutionized children’s publishing when it debuted in 1947 and has since become favorite bedtime reading for millions of families around the world. This pane of 16 stamps features eight details from the beloved picture book. including: the young bunny tucked into bed; the painting of three little bears; the toy house on the bedroom floor; the mittens and socks hung to dry; the tiny mouse paused for just a moment in front of the fireplace; the painting of the cow jumping over the Moon; the older bunny sitting in the rocking chair with her knitting; and the comb. brush. and bowl of mush atop the young bunny’s bedside table. Each scene appears twice on the pane. A celebration of the everyday. Goodnight Moon encourages children and their parents to imagine themselves in the book’s familiar \"great green room.\" where a young bunny has been tucked into bed. The lilting. hypnotic rhythm of the text casts a tender spell over young listeners. who bid goodnight to everything they see in the book\" from the toy house and kittens playing on the bedroom floor to wall paintings. a red balloon. and the Moon in the night sky. At first brightly lit. the bedroom grows gradually darker over the course of the book. echoing slumber’s slow descent. Published by Harper & Brothers in September 1947. Goodnight Moon sold an initial 6.000 copies. but sales soon dropped off. The book’s remarkable rise in popularity began in the 1950s. in large part due to word of mouth among parents. In 1996. the New York Public Library. which did not add the book to its own collection until 1972. included Goodnight Moon on its \"Books of the Century\" list. Today. Goodnight Moon has sold a total of more than 48 million copies. placing it among the best-selling children’s books of all time. Art director Derry Noyes designed the pane using existing art by Clement Hurd.",

    "description": "Antonio Alcal\" . an art director for USPS. worked on the Lunar New Year series of stamps with artist—amille Chew?to create imagery that is fresh. fun and celebratory. Calling to mind the elaborately decorated masks used in the dragon or lion dances often performed during Lunar New Year parades. Chew’s three-dimensional pieces are a contemporary take on the long tradition of paper-cut folk-art crafts created during this auspicious time of year. Using greens and blues as the predominant colors. the snake mask incorporates elements of symbolic meaning. Blue accents represent the wood element in Chinese culture. a choice befitting the Year of the Snake. Paper flowers for spring are adorned with gold leaves and orange blooms. Decorative purple baubles on blue strings hang from the mask. Chew constructed the three-dimensional snake mask out of hand-printed paper. then cut. scored and folded it into shape. She then embellished the mask with acrylic paint and other paper elements. such as flowers and tassels. and covered the back of the mask in a layer of papier-mach\" .?Sally Andersen-Bruce?then photographed the mask on a white background for this series.",

Like a sprawling celestial nautilus located 32 million light-years from Earth. spiral galaxy NGC 628 provides clues to how star formation occurs. and galaxies evolve. Captured in unprecedented detail by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2022. this and other images of spiral galaxies help scientists investigate the star formation cycle in galaxies on an unprecedented new scale and provide valuable new clues to the origins of our universe. The giant spiral arms in the image show extended regions of gas and dust that appear red and orange. Scientists have noted that the structure of this spiral galaxy is repeated elsewhere in the universe. following similar wave patterns. Studying a variety of spiral galaxies will provide key insights about how galaxies build. maintain. and shut off star formation.

Hidden within the enormous cloud of celestial dust are tiny. free-floating brown dwarfs \" objects too small to be stars but larger than most planets. Each of the three brown dwarfs is less than eight times the mass of Jupiter. The smallest has just three to four times Jupiter’s mass. a tiny celestial body among the expanse of space. Because this star cluster is young \" only about 5 million years old \" the brown dwarfs appear relatively bright in infrared light. glowing from the heat of their formation. Using JWST’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrometer) instrument. the \"spectral signature\" of a mystery molecule containing both hydrogen and carbon atoms was identified in two of the brown dwarfs. It is the first time scientists have detected the particular infrared signature of this molecule in an atmosphere outside of our own solar system. Scientists believe they are seeing this molecule because they are looking at celestial objects that are younger and smaller than ever observed before. Launched on December 25. 2021. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is the largest and most sensitive infrared telescope ever deployed in space. Revealing the cosmos in vivid infrared detail. it is designed to provide scientists with breathtaking images and new data.

After the firing of the first shots of the Revolutionary War in Massachusetts in April 1775. militias in New England were at the forefront of the fighting. While meeting in Philadelphia. the Second Continental Congress understood the need for an army to represent the colonies and resolved to establish the Continental Army on June 14. 1775. Within days. George Washington was unanimously nominated and then officially commissioned as commander in chief. Predating the establishment of the United States on July 4. 1776. by more than a year. the Army has been called America’s first national institution. With its Revolutionary-era motto \"This We’ll Defend.\" today’s Army includes approximately 450.000 active-duty soldiers. more than 325.000 soldiers in the Army National Guard. nearly 190.000 soldiers in the Army Reserve. and more than 265.000 civilians who provide mission-essential support. all of whom remain dedicated to the Army’s core values: loyalty. duty. respect. selfless service. honor. integrity. and personal courage.
